NOTE:

For Sorted Matrix: Traverse the matrix using while loop by pointers. 


                  --> There are TWO TYPES of SORTED MATRIX. 
                  
                          1st type: * Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
                                    * The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
                                    
                                    Example: matrix = [
                                                        [1,   3,  5,  7],
                                                        [10, 11, 16, 20],
                                                        [23, 30, 34, 50]
                                                                         ]
                                                                         
                                                                         
                            2nd type: * Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
                                      * Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
                                      
                                      Example: [
                                                   [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
                                                   [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
                                                   [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
                                                   [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
                                                   [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
                                                                        ]
